# Closures

A closure is a function that captures and retains access to its surrounding lexical scope, even after that scope has exited. This allows it to remember and use variables from its outer function, making it useful for encapsulation, callbacks, and functional programming patterns. Closures are common in languages like JavaScript, Python, and Swift, where functions are first-class citizens.
